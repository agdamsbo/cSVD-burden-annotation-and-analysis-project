    "text": "Suggested workflow\nIn REDCap:\n\nOpen the scoring overview in REDCap: link\nFrom the drop-down “Choose an existing Record ID”, select your first subject (allocated subjects should be consecutive).\nOpen the “SVD score” instrument to start capturing the score. If the “dot” is yellow, the instrument already has been filled. Press the “+”-sign to create a new version (mainly necessary during the inter-rater-reliability testing, as each subject is only scored once)\nIn the top of the instrument the patient CPR, name and admission time is printed as well as assigned assessor and link to Citrix.\n\nIn Citrix:\n\nOpen the “Billeddiagnostik PACS” module (find it under “APPS” and “star” it the first time) and look up the patient using the CPR number copied from REDCap.\nPlease use the subject admission date and time as reference to select the correct scan and the exact date and time of the scan (fields are pre-filled with admission date and time).\nThe scan might take a minute or two to load from the storage server. A little patience is necessary. The first time, you can use this time to arrange your program windows for optimal workflow. See the notes below.\n\nBack in REDCap:\n\nWhen done filling out all fields, you can save the data and go directly to the next subject:\nOn the right and at the end of the instrument, there are two blue boxes. The top is “Save & Exit Form”, the second have different options to choose from by clicking the arrow on the right. Choose “Save & Go To Next Record”. Then repeat step 3-8.\n\n\nNotes\n\nDuring scoring, I (Andreas) had the PACS screen maximized on the left side of a large, wide monitor, and REDCap on the right. PACS has a menu on the right, and REDCap on the left, ensuring both are centered on the screen to minimize mouse movements.\nThe instrument in REDCap is organized by sequences corresponding to how they are organized in PACS (T2*/SWI and FLAIR)."

Available sequences are DWI, ADC, 2D FLAIR, and T2* or SWI in our setting, but if available 3D FLAIR and T1 sequences should be used. Data capturing should reflect this, if data is later merged from different populations.\nScoring is performed independently by trained neurologists.

In lacunar stroke patients, the lesion could not be compatible with the clinical stroke.”(Huijts et al. 2013)\n\n\nWhite matter hyperintensities\nSequence: 2D/3D FLAIR\nThe Fazekas subscale for deep white matter is used. The scale divides the white matter in periventricular and deep white matter, and each region is given a grade depending on the size and confluence of lesions.(Fazekas et al. 1987)\nNo regional differences is noted.(Groot et al. 2000) Scoring is performed with visual reference from Radiopedia.org.\n\n\nAtrophy\nSequence: 2D/3D FLAIR or T1\nWe follow definitions for the Global Cerebral Atrophy (GCA) score.(Harper et al. 2015)\nA picture sample for reference is used.(Harper et al. 2015, fig. 1)"

    "text": "Participation\nI want to invite you all to participate in this project. I will conduct a short teaching session on the material (see later), and you will be assigned a set number of subjects to evaluate.\nThe project will run in two phases. In total I hope to have around 1000 subjects scored. Depending on how many assessors are ready to help, the math is pretty clear. The expected time use pr subject is 2-10 minutes when everything is set up.\nWhat you get for helping out:\n\nRole as co-author on the first paper based on the data and possibly participate on later publications (normal criteria for participation)\nExtensive experience evaluating SVD in acute stroke patients which will benefit you and your patients in the future\nA big thank you!\nAssess to all source code used for data acquisition and analyses (shared under an open source license)"

    "text": "Game plan\nWhen I know who is participating, I will arrange for a short teaching session to go through the materials and giving a few examples. Then I expect the work to go as follows:\n\nEveryone scores the same 10 subjects, and I will calculate inter-rater-reliability statistics. If measures are not satisfying I will go through instructions again with some added feedback, and well have to try again. If/when satisfied,\nI will allocate a specific number of subjects to each assessor (see Allocations). You can score your allocated subjects on your personal computer (please ensure adequate lightning conditions) and at any time you like. You’ll need assess to Citrix and PACS. Below is the suggested optimal workflow to speed up annotation (see Workflow).\nDuring the scoring process I will be able to follow the progress and check-in with you to provide help if needed. And I’ll make sure to create a few competitions along the way.\nWhen all participants are scored, I will be performing analyses and send the draft manuscript for comments."
