    "section": "Definitions on bio-markers",
    "text": "Definitions on bio-markers\nDefinitions are mainly according to the STRIVE v1 criteria,(Joanna M. Wardlaw et al. 2013) with minor local specifications. The bio-markers included are within the suggestions from Markus et al. (2022) in the FINESSE framework.\n\nMicrobleeds\nSequence: T2*/SWI\nSmall (generally 2–5 mm in diameter, but sometimes up to 10 mm) areas of signal void with associated blooming seen on SWI-weighted MRI.\nDifferent cut-offs are used in different trials.(Akoudad et al. 2016) We try to register in a way, so that our analysis can be made similarly to other studies and to provide enough resolution.\nAs discussions about the importance of location is ongoing,(Vernooij et al. 2008) we register if microbleeds are located lobar, deep, or infratentorial.\n\n\nSuperficial siderosis\nSequence: T2*/SWI\n“Investigators should describe the location of siderosis (i.e., the number of sulci involved and in which lobes).”(Joanna M. Wardlaw et al. 2013, 828)\n\n\nLacunar infarcts\nSequence: 2D/3D FLAIR\n“A round or ovoid, subcortical, fluid-filled cavity (signal similar to CSF) of between 3 mm and about 15 mm in diameter, consistent with a previous acute small subcortical infarct or haemorrhage in the territory of one perforating arteriole.”(Joanna M. Wardlaw et al. 2013, 825)\nAdditionally: “We identified asymptomatic lacunar infarcts as sharply demarcated hyperintense lesions &lt;20 mm on T2-weighted images with corresponding hypointense lesions with a hyperintense rim on FLAIR. In lacunar stroke patients, the lesion could not be compatible with the clinical stroke.”(Huijts et al. 2013)\nBased on the practice by Olama et al. (2020) and the 2021 ESO guidelines on covert small vessel disease, lacunes are counted 0, 1 , 2 , 3-5 and &gt;5.(Joanna M. Wardlaw et al. 2021)\n\n\nWhite matter hyperintensities\nSequence: 2D/3D FLAIR\nThe Fazekas subscale for deep white matter is used. The scale divides the white matter in periventricular and deep white matter, and each region is given a grade depending on the size and confluence of lesions.(Fazekas et al. 1987)\nNo regional differences is noted.(Groot et al. 2000) Scoring is performed with visual reference from Radiopedia.org.\n\n\nAtrophy\nSequence: 2D/3D FLAIR or T1\nWe follow definitions for the Global Cerebral Atrophy (GCA) score.(Harper et al. 2015)\nA picture sample for reference is used.(Harper et al. 2015, fig. 1)"

Press the “+”-sign to create a new version (mainly necessary during the inter-rater-reliability testing, as each subject is only scored once)\n\nIn the top of the instrument, the patient CPR, name and admission time is printed as well as assessor allocated (should be you, but please check) and link to Citrix for convenience.\n\nIn Citrix/PACS:\n\nOpen the “Billeddiagnostik PACS” module (find it under “APPS” and “star” it the first time) and look up the patient using the CPR number copied from REDCap.\nPlease use the subject admission date and time as reference to select the correct scan and the exact date and time of the scan (fields are pre-filled with admission date and time).\nThe scan might take a minute or two to load from the storage server. A little patience is necessary. The first time, you can use this time to arrange your program windows for optimal workflow.\n\nMaximise the “PACS” window on the left half of yuor screen and “REDCap” on the left (to have controls line up in the middle and minimize cursor movement)\nNote that the REDCap is organized by MRI sequences (T2*/SWI and FLAIR) corresponding to how they are organized in PACS. The relevant sequences are usually found at the buttom of the list in PACS.\n\n\nIn REDCap:\n\nWhen done filling out all fields, you can save the data and go directly to the next subject by clicking “Save & Go To Next Record”\n\nThe last item is “Complete?”. Use “Incomplete” if interrupted, “Unverified” in case of doubt, “Complete” when completed.\nOn the right and at the end of the instrument, there are two blue boxes. The top is “Save & Exit Form”, the second have different options to choose from by clicking the arrow on the right. Choose “Save & Go To Next Record”. Then repeat step 3-8."

Inter-rater-reliability statistics are calculated on both the full scale and a shortened scale with a Cohens 𝛋 of respectively .7 and .8 as the goal before continued scoring. If measures are not satisfying group session with scoring examples will be repeated.\nAfter the first assessment relibility phase, each assessor will have a number of subjects allocated for scoring/annotation (see Allocations). Annotation can be performed on standard personal work station/computer (please ensure adequate lightning conditions) and at any time. You’ll need access to Citrix and PACS (see Workflow for a suggested optimal workflow).\nDuring the scoring process I will be able to follow the progress and check-in with you to provide help if needed. And I’ll make sure to create a few competitions along the way.\nWhen all participants are scored, I will be running analyses and send the draft manuscript for comments."
