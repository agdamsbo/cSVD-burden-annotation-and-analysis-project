## On allocating assessors

Thinking a lot back and forth, I did consider

-   REDCap project with surveys for assessors to request more subjects

-   Shiny app with similar functionality

-   Oldschool spreadsheet with manual updates

Conclusion: KEEP IT SIMPLE

We go with the last option!

These are the currently allocated subjects

```{r}
source(here::here("data_local/local.R"))
source(here::here("R/functions.R"))
```

```{r}
# assessor_key2
# ds <- get_allocations()
```

This is source data:

```{r}
system2("open", "data/allocation.ods")
```

Show allocations

```{r}
allos <- allocate_assessors(key=assessor_key2)
allos |> dplyr::filter(allocated_assessor!="all") |> gt::gt()
```

Write updated data frame of assessors:

```{r}
allos |> write2db()
```
