Small vessel disease burden project (Pooled TALOS and RESIST)

# Introduction

SVD in the brain is still uncharted territory. We have two large
datasets (possibly supplemented with additional projects) on acute
stroke patients that we have the opportunity to merge and link with data
from MRI scans. The first project is to investigate the relationship
between various lifestyle factors and the degree of SVD among stroke
patients. We also plan to use the data for other projects in the future.

# Establishing a Consensus

No widely used scoring system exists, that considers all elements of
SVD. The Fazekas score is widely used, but only accounts for white
matter hyperintensities (WMH).

Based on existing studies, we have developed a scoring tool for this
purpose, relying on FLAIR and T2\*/SWI sequences from the acute scans.
We are interested in microbleeds, superficial siderosis, previous
lacunar infarcts, white matter hyperintensities, and atrophy.

We have created a minimal registration tool in REDCap, that will later
be enriched with metadata on the scans.

# Participation

I want to invite you all to participate in this project. I will conduct
a short teaching session on the material (see later), and you will be
assigned a set number of subjects to evaluate.

Your benefits:

-       Role as co-author on the first paper based on the data and
possibly participate on later publications (normal criteria for
participation)

-       Extensive experience evaluating SVD in acute stroke patients
which will benefit you and your patients in the future

-       A big thank you

-       Access to all source code used for data acquisition and analyses
(shared under an open source license)

When I get your response, I

\*\*Slide 5: Educational Material\*\*

\- \*\*Objective:\*\* Facilitate understanding through various
resources.

\- Create instructional videos or documentation.

\- Ensure scoring can be done on a standard computer.

\- Consider a short course with examples (pull from ENIGMA).

\*\*Slide 6: Initial Scoring and Reliability Test\*\*

\- \*\*Objective:\*\* Ensure consistency.

\- All participants perform the same first 10 scorings.

\- Conduct an inter-rater-reliability test.

\- If acceptable, proceed; if not, rerun education.

\-\--

\*\*Slide 7: Team Engagement\*\*

\- \*\*Objective:\*\* Maintain motivation and collaboration.

\- Delegate a set number of subjects to each colleague.

\- Foster team spirit through friendly competitions.

\-\--

\*\*Slide 8: Project Milestones\*\*

\- Highlight key milestones and deadlines.

\- Regular check-ins and progress updates.

\-\--

\*\*Slide 9: Q&A\*\*

\- Open the floor for questions and discussions.

\-\--

\*\*Slide 10: Conclusion\*\*

\- Thank you for your commitment to advancing our MRI-based scans!

\- Stay tuned for updates and let's make Project C a success together!
