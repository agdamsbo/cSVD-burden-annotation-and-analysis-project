## Project plan

-   Scoring introduction arranged

-   Everyone scores the same initial 50 subjects.
    Inter-rater-reliability statistics are calculated on both the full
    scale and a shortened scale with a Cohens ùõã of respectively .7 and
    .8 as the goal before continued scoring. If measures are not
    satisfying group session with scoring examples will be repeated.

-   When the project is continued, each assessor will have a numbe rof
    subjects allocated for scoring/annotation (see
    [Allocations](down-to-work.qmd#sec-allocations)). Annotation can be
    performed on standard personal work station/computer (please ensure
    adequate lightning conditions) and at any time. You'll need access
    to Citrix and PACS (see
    [Workflow](down-to-work.qmd#sec-suggested-workflow) for a suggested
    optimal workflow).

-   During the scoring process I will be able to follow the progress and
    check-in with you to provide help if needed. And I'll make sure to
    create a few competitions along the way.

-   When all participants are scored, I will be running analyses and
    send the draft manuscript for comments.
