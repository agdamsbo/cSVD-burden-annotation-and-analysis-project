## Project plan

When I know who is participating, I will arrange for a short teaching session to go through the materials and giving a few examples. Then I expect the work to go as follows:

-   Everyone scores the same 50 subjects, and I will calculate inter-rater-reliability statistics. If measures are not satisfying I will go through instructions again with some added feedback, and well have to try again. If/when satisfied,

-   I will allocate a specific number of subjects to each assessor (see [Allocations](down-to-work.qmd#sec-allocations)). You can score your allocated subjects on your personal computer (please ensure adequate lightning conditions) and at any time you like. You'll need assess to Citrix and PACS (see [Workflow](down-to-work.qmd#sec-suggested-workflow) for a suggested optimal workflow).

-   During the scoring process I will be able to follow the progress and check-in with you to provide help if needed. And I'll make sure to create a few competitions along the way.

-   When all participants are scored, I will be running analyses and send the draft manuscript for comments.
