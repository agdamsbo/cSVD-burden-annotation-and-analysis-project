## Suggested workflow {#sec-suggested-workflow}

**In REDCap:**

1.  Login to AU REDCap, open the "SVD-burden POOL" project and go to
    "**Add / Edit Records**" ([just follow this
    link](https://redcap.au.dk/redcap_v13.7.21/DataEntry/record_home.php?pid=8420))

2.  From the drop-down "**Choose an existing Record ID**", select your
    first subject (allocated subjects are in consecutive order)

3.  Open the "SVD score" instrument to start capturing the score.

    -   If the "dot" is colored, the instrument already has been filled.
        Press the "+"-sign to create a new version (mainly necessary
        during the inter-rater-reliability testing, as each subject is
        only scored once)

4.  In the top of the instrument, the patient CPR, name and admission
    time is printed as well as assessor allocated (should be you) and
    link to Citrix.

**In Citrix:**

5.  Open the "Billeddiagnostik PACS" module (find it under "APPS" and
    "star" it the first time) and look up the patient using the CPR
    number copied from REDCap.

6.  Please use the subject admission date and time as reference to
    select the correct scan and the exact date and time of the scan
    (fields are pre-filled with admission date and time).

7.  The scan might take a minute or two to load from the storage server.
    A little patience is necessary. The first time, you can use this
    time to arrange your program windows for optimal workflow. See the
    notes below.

**Back in REDCap:**

8.  When done filling out all fields, you can save the data and go
    directly to the next subject:

    On the right and at the end of the instrument, there are two blue
    boxes. The top is "Save & Exit Form", the second have different
    options to choose from by clicking the arrow on the right. Choose
    "Save & Go To Next Record". Then repeat step 3-8.

### Notes {#sec-notes}

-   During scoring, I (Andreas) had the PACS screen maximized on the
    left side of a large, wide monitor, and REDCap on the right. PACS
    has a menu on the right, and REDCap on the left, ensuring both are
    centered on the screen to minimize mouse movements.
-   The instrument in REDCap is organized by sequences corresponding to
    how they are organized in PACS (T2\*/SWI and FLAIR).
