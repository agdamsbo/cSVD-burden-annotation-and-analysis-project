We have two large\ndatasets (possibly supplemented with additional projects) on acute\nstroke patients that we have the opportunity to merge and link with data\nfrom MRI scans. The first project is to investigate the relationship\nbetween various lifestyle factors and the degree of SVD among stroke\npatients. We also plan to use the data for other projects in the future.\n\n## Annotation and capturing\n\nNo widely used scoring system exists, that considers all elements of SVD\non MRI. The Fazekas score is widely used, but only accounts for white\nmatter hyperintensities (WMH).\n\nBased on existing studies, [we have developed a scoring tool for this\npurpose](https://agdamsbo.github.io/cSVD-burden-annotation-and-analysis-project/doc/svd-score.html),\nrelying on FLAIR and T2\\*/SWI sequences from the acute scans. We are\ninterested in microbleeds, superficial siderosis, previous lacunar\ninfarcts, white matter hyperintensities, and atrophy.\n\nWe have created a minimal registration tool in REDCap, that will later\nbe enriched with metadata on the scans.\n\n## Participation\n\nI want to invite you all to participate in this project. I will conduct\na short teaching session on the material (see later), and you will be\nassigned a set number of subjects to evaluate.\n\nThe project will run in two phases. In total I hope to have around 1000\nsubjects scored. Depending on how many accessors are ready to help, the\nmath is pretty clear. The expected time use pr subject is 2-10 minutes\nwhen everything is set up.\n\nWhat you get for helping out:\n\n-   Role as co-author on the first paper based on the data and possibly\n    participate on later publications (normal criteria for\n    participation)\n\n-   Extensive experience evaluating SVD in acute stroke patients which\n    will benefit you and your patients in the future\n\n-   A big thank you!\n\n-   Access to all source code used for data acquisition and analyses\n    (shared under an open source license)\n\n## Game plan\n\nWhen I know who is participating, I will arrange for a short teaching\nsession to go through the materials and giving a few examples. Then I\nexpect the work to go as follows:\n\n-   Everyone scores the same 10 subjects, and I will calculate\n    inter-rater-reliability statistics. If measures are not satisfying I\n    will go through instructions again with some added feedback, and\n    well have to try again. If/when satisfied,\n\n-   I will allocate a specific number of subjects to each accessor (see\n    @allocation-table). You can score your allocated subjects on your\n    personal computer (please ensure adequate lightning conditions) and\n    at any time you like. You'll need access to Citrix and PACS. Below\n    is the suggested optimal workflow to speed up annotation.\n\n-   During the scoring process I will be able to follow the progress and\n    check-in with you to provide help if needed. And I'll make sure to\n    create a few competitions along the way.\n\n-   When all participants are scored, I will be performing analyses and\n    send the draft manuscript for comments.\n\n## Allocations\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell tbl-cap='Allocation of subject IDs'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|accessor |IDs       |\n|:--------|:---------|\n|all      |svd_1-10  |\n|andlau   |svd_11-50 |\n:::\n:::\n",
