## About

This page is intended as a reference manual for accessors as well as
other collaborators in annotating and analysing a large pooled, clinical
dataset of stroke patients from Aarhus University Hospital included in
different research projects.

### Motivation

SVD in the brain is still uncharted territory. We have two large
datasets (possibly supplemented with additional projects) on acute
stroke patients that we have the opportunity to merge and link with data
from MRI scans. The first project is to investigate the relationship
between various lifestyle factors and the degree of SVD among stroke
patients. We also plan to use the data for other projects in the future.

### Annotation and capturing

No widely used scoring system exists, that considers all elements of SVD
on MRI. The Fazekas score is widely used, but only accounts for white
matter hyperintensities (WMH).

Based on existing studies, we have developed a scoring tool for this
purpose, relying on FLAIR and T2\*/SWI sequences from the acute scans.
We are interested in microbleeds, superficial siderosis, previous
lacunar infarcts, white matter hyperintensities, and atrophy.

We have created a minimal registration tool in REDCap, that will later
be enriched with metadata on the scans.
